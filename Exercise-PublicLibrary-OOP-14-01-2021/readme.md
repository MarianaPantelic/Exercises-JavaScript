A library has 2 shelves. A shelf can contain from 0 to 5 books max.

Each book has:

- number of pages
- an author
- a title
- the year when it was published

Each author has a first name, last name, age, city of residence.

A book can be a novel or a school text-book

Write functionalities so that:

- you can add a book to a shelf
- you can print how many and what books a certain shelf has. (A)
- you can move a book from one shelf to another
- a shelf cannot have no more than 5 books

Create the shelves, create a few authors and many books.

Add the books to the libraries. And start by moving the books from one shelf to another. Use the shelf.displayBooks() function (A) to see the result.

A few more complex functionalities to implement: (weekend exercise)

- you can burn books that were published before a certain year
- you can inspect the library to return the books of a certain author
- you can move books to another shelf if they have more than X pages
- you can print how many and what books an author published

Use the complex functions to destroy the books you do not like and move others between shelves. Inspect the result with the print functions
